mstsc /v:n.n.n.n /admin

/*
To connect to the Terminal Server despite the limited connections, what you can do is to connect to the server with the /admin switch. To do this, launch mstsc as follows:

mstsc /v:n.n.n.n /admin
Replace n.n.n.n with the IP of the server and youâ€™re good to go. Once connected to the server, use Task Manager to log off the sessions that are no longer used.

To do this, select the session you wish to disconnect and click Logoff. Note that this will effectively log off the session and closes all windows still open in that session!

Once these steps have been completed, log your current session off and you should be able to reconnect to the server without using the /admin switch.
